## About The Project
This project is about utilizing valuation tools for a quicker set up of a fundamental valuation for a company. The framework of the inputs and model follows [Aswath Damodaran's lectures and writings](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/).

Inputs such as Betas, Country Risk Premiums, Implied Equity Risk Premiums have mostly been automated (I am working on automate the refresh of underlying economic data as well). The final model is a Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) model. The data source I use is [koyfin.com](https://app.koyfin.com/) and utilizing a [koyfin data bot that I have created](https://github.com/gafzan/Koyfin) to retreive estimates and company fundamentals. In the future I might add a free data source as well like Yahoo Finance.

The result of every valuation can be displayed as a Monte-Carlo simulation, price distribution and discount cash flow model in excel where all the inputs can be adjusted manually.
